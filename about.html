        <p><em>For a child has been born to us,
            a son has been given to us.
            He shoulders responsibility
            and is called
            Wonderful Adviser,
            Mighty God,
            Everlasting Father,
            Prince of Peace.
            His dominion will be vast,
            and he will bring immeasurable prosperity.
            He will rule on David’s throne
            and over David’s kingdom,
            establishing it and strengthening it
            by promoting justice and fairness,
            from this time forward and forevermore.
            The zeal of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will accomplish this. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+9%3A6-7&version=NET">Isaiah 9:6-7</a></em></p>
            <p>Christmas is a season of new birth, hope, peace, joy, and love. It is a contemplative season where we meditate on the promises of God regarding the salvation of the whole world (this includes both Jews <strong>and Gentiles.</strong> We tell the story of the birth of Christ with family, friends, and loved ones, and celebrate the arrival of our promised Messiah: Jesus Christ, the Son of God, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary.</p>
            <p>But the story doesn't end in the manger. Christmas not only tells of the birth of Christ, but the <em>whole reason for His arrival!</em> Scripture tells us that Jesus is "the Word who was in the beginning with God," who is by very nature God, the very one who created everything in the beginning. He is called "Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End, First and Last." He is the "King of Kings, Lord of Lord, God over all creation. The one by whose right hand sustains the universe."</p>
            <p>This mighty King laid down His glory and splendor and took up an inhabitance of brokenness. He laid aside His majesty and took upon Himself a robe of humanity. The reason? Love for us. Love for the Father. A desire to reunite us with our first love. To do this He took upon Himself the punishment we deserved. "He who knew no sin, became sin, so we might become the righteousness of God." Jesus is "the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world."</p>
            <p>Not only did He come for us to be saved, but also that God might be glorified. Becoming flesh, He submitted Himself completely to the Father's will. As is said in the letter to the Philippeans,</p>
            <p><em>who though he existed in the form of God
                did not regard equality with God
                as something to be grasped,
                but emptied himself
                by taking on the form of a slave,
                by looking like other men,
                and by sharing in human nature.
                He humbled himself,
                by becoming obedient to the point of death
                —even death on a cross!
                As a result God highly exalted him
                and gave him the name
                that is above every name,
                so that at the name of Jesus
                every knee will bow
                —in heaven and on earth and under the earth—
                and every tongue confess
                that Jesus Christ is Lord
                to the glory of God the Father.</em></p>
                <p>And as Christ said before He was crucified,</p>
                <p><em>When Jesus had finished saying these things, he looked upward to heaven and said, “Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, so that your Son may glorify you— just as you have given him authority over all humanity, so that he may give eternal life to everyone you have given him. Now this is eternal life—that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you sent. I glorified you on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me at your side with the glory I had with you before the world was created.</em></p>
                <p>So this Christmas season, turn your eyes to the Father and have your focus be on His greatness, His love, His faithfulness, and meditate on the promises and prophesies He has given, knowing with all certainty that His Word is true.</p>
                <p>The Lord bless you and your families, that He might be glorified through your faithfulness and works, and so you may know Him better, and so the unbelievers who see you might come to believe and be saved. Amen.</p>
