            <h3>Jesus Christ would be born of a virgin</body></h3>
            <p><em>"For this reason the Lord himself will give you a confirming sign. Look, this young woman is about to conceive and will give birth to a son. You, young woman, will name him Immanuel." ~ <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+7%3A14&version=NET">Isaiah 7:14</a></em></p>
            <h3>Jesus Christ would be a prophet like Moses</h3>
            <p><em>"The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you—from your fellow Israelites; you must listen to him. This accords with what happened at Horeb in the day of the assembly. You asked the Lord your God: “Please do not make us hear the voice of the Lord our God anymore or see this great fire anymore lest we die.” The Lord then said to me, “What they have said is good. I will raise up a prophet like you for them from among their fellow Israelites. I will put my words in his mouth and he will speak to them whatever I command. I will personally hold responsible anyone who then pays no attention to the words that prophet speaks in my name." ~ <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+18%3A15-19&version=NET">Deuteronomy 18:15-19</a></em></p>
            <h3>Jesus Christ would bring in a new covenant</h3>
            <p><em>"“Indeed, a time is coming,” says the Lord, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah." ~ <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+31%3A31&version=NET">Jeremiah 31:31</a></em></p>
            <h3>Jesus Christ would be called God’s Son</h3>
            <p><em>"Why do the nations rebel?
                Why are the countries devising plots that will fail?
                The kings of the earth form a united front;
                the rulers collaborate
                against the Lord and his anointed king.
                They say, “Let’s tear off the shackles they’ve put on us.
                Let’s free ourselves from their ropes.”
                The one enthroned in heaven laughs in disgust;
                the Lord taunts them.
                Then he angrily speaks to them
                and terrifies them in his rage, saying,
                “I myself have installed my king
                on Zion, my holy hill.”
                The king says, “I will announce the Lord’s decree. He said to me:
                ‘You are my son. This very day I have become your father.
                Ask me,
                and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,
                the ends of the earth as your personal property.
                You will break them with an iron scepter;
                you will smash them like a potter’s jar.’”
                So now, you kings, do what is wise;
                you rulers of the earth, submit to correction.
                Serve the Lord in fear.
                Repent in terror.
                Give sincere homage.
                Otherwise he will be angry,
                and you will die because of your behavior,
                when his anger quickly ignites.
                How blessed are all who take shelter in him!" ~ <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+2&version=NET">Psalm 2</a></em></p>
                <h3>Jesus Christ would be pierced</h3>
                <p><em>I will pour out on the kingship of David and the population of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication so that they will look to me, the one they have pierced. They will lament for him as one laments for an only son, and there will be a bitter cry for him like the bitter cry for a firstborn. ~ <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+12%3A10&version=NET">Zechariah 12:10</a></em></p>
                <h3>Jesus Christ would be resurrected</h3>
                <p><em>I constantly trust in the Lord;
                    because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
                    So my heart rejoices
                    and I am happy;
                    my life is safe.
                    You will not abandon me to Sheol;
                    you will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit.
                    You lead me in the path of life.
                    I experience absolute joy in your presence;
                    you always give me sheer delight. ~ <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+16%3A8-11&version=NET">Psalm 16:8-11</a></em></p>
